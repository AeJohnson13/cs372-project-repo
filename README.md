For this project to work you must have on your laptop a connection named 'SC-Project', with a database also named 'SC-Project', and within this the collections 'User Credentials' and 'Video Library', which can be imported from the videos.json file.

Users can be created using the sign-up page, by default they will only have viewer privileges, additional privilege have to be added manually by editing the 'roles' object within the user's database entry.
